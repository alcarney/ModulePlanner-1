* Module Planner

The module planner is a jekyll website combined with some javascript magic which
will present the user with an interactive graph of modules for their selected
degree course.

Users will also be able to select certain modules and then see how these choices
will affect their possible future courses. This will allow them to help decide
which modules makes the most sense for their degree program.

This site contains the documentation for the how this site is implemented.
